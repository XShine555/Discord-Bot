# Discord-Bot
Simple Discord Bot written in Python using Pomice and Discord.py. It's not the best but at least it is a first version, there are many commands that are not yet implemented and tested correctly. This is a hobby so i'm not going to update the Bot frequently.

Requirements:
· Pomice.py ( >= 2.5 )
· Discord.py ( >= 2.5 )

To-Do List:
· Embeds for the player.
· Clean the code in the two scripts.
· Make it more responsive.
· Add additional commands (Jump, Loop Queue...)
· Maybe add custom Prefix/Language for every person in the server (I know this sounds crazy but just imagine how cool can be that)
· More extensions (Moderation, Welcome...)
· Make DB better.
